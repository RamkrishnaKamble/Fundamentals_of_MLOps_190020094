# a)
AIOps is short for artificial intelligence for IT operations. It refers to multi-layered technology platforms that automate and 
IT operations through analytics and machine learning (ML). AIOps platforms leverage big data, collecting a variety of data from
various IT operations tools and devices in order to automatically spot and react to issues in real-time while still providing
traditional historical analytics.
AIOps has two main components: big data and ML. Hence we can see that AIOps use ML as its main pillar the difference is AIops
automates machine while MLOps standardize process. To put it simply AIOps use Machine intelligence to solve problem and 
capablity to solve problems without any human intervention. On the other hand MLOps focuses the collaboration between data
scientists and the operations unit within an organization. Its main goal is to bridge gap between data scientists and operation
teams.
